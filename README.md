A RabbitMQ connector for [Broadway](https://github.com/dashbitco/broadway).

Documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/broadway_rabbitmq][docs].
For more details on using Broadway with RabbitMQ, please see the
[RabbitMQ Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/broadway/rabbitmq.html).

## Installation

Add `:broadway_rabbitmq` to the list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:broadway_rabbitmq, "~> 0.7.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Configure Broadway with one or more producers using `BroadwayRabbitMQ.Producer`:

```elixir
  defmodule MyBroadway do
    use Broadway

    def start_link(_opts) do
      Broadway.start_link(__MODULE__,
        name: __MODULE__,
        producer: [
          module: {BroadwayRabbitMQ.Producer,
            queue: "my_queue",
          },
          concurrency: 1
        ],
        processors: [
          default: [
            concurrency: 10
          ]
        ]
      )
    end

    def handle_message(_, message, _) do
      IO.inspect(message.data, label: "Got message")
      message
    end
  end
```

## Contributing

To run tests that don't need any dependency, use:

```bash
mix test --exclude integration
```

To run integration tests, you'll need RabbitMQ running on your `localhost:5672`.
For simplicity, this repository includes a
[`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file that you can use to run
RabbitMQ via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If you have
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then, you can run `mix test`.
